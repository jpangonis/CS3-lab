standard sort ran for 0.016819 seconds
bubble sort ran for 418.571 seconds
insertion sort ran for 6e-06 seconds

It is clear that the bubble sort takes significantly more time than the standard sort and the insertion sort.
In terms of efficiency, insertion sort is by far the fastest sorting algorithm.
